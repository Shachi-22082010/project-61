        <p>
            My favourite hobby is baking because it relaxes me and i fell happyand joyful. The kitchen is my happy
            place. I want to make baking as my career in the future. I generally bake dessets like cupcakes, cookies ,
            cakes etc. When i make anything my family motivates me to do more and more of baking. My dream is to go to
            "Masterchef" and cook in that kitchen.
            I am inspired by the cooks in the masterchef kitchen and especially the winner Mary Berg who won the
            masterchef Canada season 3.

        <p>
            I like Alia Bhatt because she is a fabulous actor and she is really good looking.Alia Bhatt (born 15 March
            1993) is a British Indian film actress and singer who works in Bollywood. Born into the Bhatt family, she is
            the daughter of filmmaker Mahesh Bhatt and actress Soni Razdan. After making her acting debut as a child
            artist in the 1999 thriller Sangharsh, Bhatt played her first leading role in Karan Johar's romantic drama
            Student of the Year (2012), which earned her a nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Female Debut.Bhatt
            established herself in Bollywood by starring as the female lead in several commercially successful films,
            including the romantic drama 2 States (2014), the romantic comedy Humpty Sharma Ki Dulhania (2014), the
            drama Kapoor & Sons (2016), the coming-of-age film Dear Zindagi (2016), and the romantic comedy Badrinath Ki
            Dulhania(2017). She received critical acclaim for portraying emotionally intense characters in the road
            drama Highway (2014), which won her the Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actress, and the crime drama Udta
            Punjab(2016), which won her the Filmfare Award for Best Actress.

            In addition to acting in films, Bhatt has launched her own line of clothing for women. She has sung six of
            her film songs and participates in stage shows and concert tours.
